# Week 2: Discover the Airbnb Dataset (and Filter It!)

Hi! üëãüëãüëã Are you excited to start the second week's project for Python for Data Science? 

This week's lecture and material on CoRise showed you how to clean a DataFrame and merge one DataFrame into another. As you might have noticed, our dataset this week has way more columns than our dataset from Week 1. This is much more true to real life. It's messy, it's bloated, every time is unique, and above all, it's MUCH MORE interesting!

For this project, we saved an older version of the "clean" **Listings DataFrame** so that you can apply all the steps we performed on the **Calendar DataFrame** directly to this older version and reproduce the methods you learned on slightly different data. Let's get started üí™üí™!

## Downloading the Dataset

You'll need to download some prerequisite Python packages in order to run all the code below. Let's install them!
"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %%capture
# !pip install numpy pandas streamlit gdown pyarrow

"""We will download the datasets from Google Drive just like we did last week, but this time the datasets are in [Pickle](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter11.03-Pickle-Files.html) and [Parquet](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/parquet.html) format. """

"""## Preprocessing the Dataset
Please load the downloaded files as DataFrames (dfs). The method for loading these datasets is the same as what we did on the CoRise platform.

"""Now instead of cleaning the **Calendar DataFrame**, you are going to clean the **Listings DataFrame**. You will use the same steps we used to clean the Calendar data on the CoRise platform this week. Let's first get an overview of the columns that are in this particular DataFrame üßê.

"""This info printout provides a good overview of which columns we need to investigate further. We saw on CoRise this week that columns with the dtype **object** and sometimes **float** require inspection and cleaning.

Let's start first with the `discount_per_...` columns, where your output should look somthing like this

```

Perform this four-step process to change each of the three `discount_per_...` columns into their proper format:
1. Remove non-numeric characters, like the percent symbol, so you can perform mathematical calculations on the column
1. Change the column into a `float` data type in order to convert the data into a ratio
1. Multiply the whole column by 0.01 so you end up with a probability ratio instead of a percentage
1. Overwrite the old `discount_per_...` column with this new column

Perform these four steps for all thee columns.

***Please note that running this code block more than once might cause an error. This is because you are re-assigning your columns with this code, and if you run the code again, the variable/column you are referring to has already been changed to its preferred state.***

* `host_listings_count`
* `host_total_listings_count`
* `availability_60`
* `availability_90`
* `availability_365`

To summarize, your cleanup so far has reduced memory usage by almost half, which admittedly given the current amount of memory we are using does not really matter that much. But more importantly, our DataFrame is also more readable now, and we can continue to process it in the next sections.

We are going to merge the pivot table that includes the `five_day_dollar_price` for each listing with `listings_df`. We have to keep in mind that we want to keep only those rows of Airbnb listing IDs that are present in both datasets.

#### Task 17: Mergin'

[*\[Related section on CoRise\]*](https://corise.com/course/python-for-data-science/v2/module/merging-pros#corise_cl9wp1zf9007m3b6pfiawiagd)

Let's use the [`pd.merge()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html) operation as was shown on CoRise, with the pivot table on the right and the **Listings DataFrame** on the left. Make sure to provide which columns you want to join on for our pivot table and the DataFrame.


The expected merged table should look same as

|index|id|host\_acceptance\_rate|host\_is\_superhost|neighbourhood\_cleansed|latitude|longitude|room\_type|accommodates|bedrooms|beds|amenities|price|minimum\_nights|maximum\_nights|has\_availability|availability\_30|number\_of\_reviews\_l30d|review\_scores\_rating|instant\_bookable|price\_per\_person|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|35815036|1\.0|true|Noord-Oost|52\.42419|4\.95689|Entire home/apt|2|1|1|5|105\.0|3|100|true|4|6|4\.96|false|52\.5|
|1|19572024|1\.0|false|Watergraafsmeer|52\.30739|4\.90833|Entire home/apt|6|3|6|14|279\.0|3|300|true|6|3|4\.69|false|46\.5|
|2|2973384|0\.38|false|Watergraafsmeer|52\.30989|4\.90528|Entire home/apt|5|3|3|7|185\.0|6|21|true|0|0|4\.83|false|37\.0|
"""

final_df = pd.merge(
    df_list, calendar_summarizeddf, left_on=["id"],
    right_on=["listing_id"]
    # inner join by DEFAULT
)
final_df.head(3)

#### (Extra Credit) Task 18: Groups are great

[*\[Related section on CoRise\]*](https://corise.com/course/python-for-data-science/v2/module/data-explore-stats#corise_cl9wpp3t100n53b6pmv167sm7)

Now, let's perform a [`groupby`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) where we look at the median values of `five_day_dollar_price` and `review_scores_accuracy` with respect to the `room_type`. Do these results match your intuition?


The expected group by table should look same as,

|room\_type|review\_scores\_rating|five\_day\_dollar\_price|
|---|---|---|
|Entire home/apt|4\.88|972\.7397260273973|
|Hotel room|4\.5649999999999995|908\.1575342465753|
|Private room|4\.79|681\.986301369863|
|Shared room|4\.6|565\.027397260274|
"""

final_df.groupby(by=["room_type"]) [[
    "review_scores_rating",
     "five_day_dollar_price"
     ]].median()

"""You might have expected that shared rooms are the cheapest and thus have the lowest rating with respect to median scores. The same can't be said for the most expensive option ‚Äî a hotel room. Will this influence your future considerations when booking ü§î?

(But before you let this influence your decisions too much, it might be better to assume that this data might be biased in favor of Airbnb and not hotels in general. ü§∑)

You've walked through all the most important parts of Pandas. It's a really easy-to-use library that shares a lot of syntax with NumPy. It is great for analyzing and cleaning datasets, and as you might have discovered with the previous code, Pandas allows you to really go into the nitty-gritty details of your dataset. These skills are invaluable for a data scientist, and will empower you to utilize data where you work now, or even where you could work in the future!

The next steps involve downloading the files to your local computer so that you can make an app for your portfolio. After, we will provide some suggestions on how you can extend this project, along with some interesting links to investigate.

### Download the Dataset to Your Local Machine

Let's first export our final DataFrame.
"""

final_df.to_csv(
    "WK2_Airbnb_Amsterdam_listings_proj_solution.csv",
    index=True,
)

"""Google Colab comes with its own Python packages that allow us to quickly download generated files, like so:"""

from google.colab import files

# Download the file locally
files.download('WK2_Airbnb_Amsterdam_listings_proj_solution.csv')

"""### Make an App for Your Portfolio!

**Participants such as yourselves often want to use the weekly CoRise projects for their portfolios. To facilitate that, we've created this section. It might seem like a lot, but it's actually just following instructions and copy-pasting. Reach out on Slack if you get stuck!** 

You will make an app that visualizes the dataset as a DataFrame and as a geographic visualization like so:

<br/>

To visualize this, we will again use a library called [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). For now you are not expected to know how Streamlit works, but you are expected to be able to copy-paste and follow instructions if you want to share this project as part of your portfolio!

We are going to use [Streamlit Share](https://share.streamlit.io/) to host your projects. It's a website that allows us to host our interactive projects for free online! Again, we don't expect you to understand how to use and/or modify the code shown below. We do expect you to read the instructions and copy-paste our code to the Streamlit Share platform. Feel free to change it any way you like. Some great starting points are [here](https://python.plainenglish.io/how-to-build-web-app-using-streamlit-pandas-numpy-5e134f0cf552), [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/create-an-app), [here](https://streamlit.io/components), and [here](https://streamlit.io/gallery)!

The `app.py` below is based on [this code](https://github.com/tylerjrichards/st-filter-dataframe/blob/main/streamlit_app.py). Feel free to extend it if you like!

# üéâ CONGRATULATIONS!!!

You've made it to the end of the Week 2 assignment! You should be proud. 

If you have any lingering questions, post them on Slack! As you know, we're always here to help.

And if you want any additional challenge questions, check out the bonus extensions below.

<br/>

Awesome üéâüéâüéâ you are finished with all the tasks! How about considering running [D-Tale](https://github.com/man-group/dtale) on your DataFrames, so you can interactively explore your dataset? What about getting a visual representation of the data and thus a quick overview of what's goin' on by using [Lux](https://github.com/lux-org/lux) or [Sweetviz](https://pypi.org/project/sweetviz/)?

If optimizing code gets you excited, then try to see how you can maximize these performance numbers even more. Maybe it's time to try running this code using [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf), [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars), or [Vaex](https://github.com/vaexio/vaex)?

# Next Up?
This is the last project of our course üò≠üò≠. Please do not be sad! We would like to invite you to read the "What's Next?" post in Week 3, as it contains great suggestions on how you can proceed with your learning journey at CoRise (yes, please!) or somewhere else!
